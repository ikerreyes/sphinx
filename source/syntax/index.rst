reST and Sphinx markup constructs
=================================

This document is intended to give some ideas of how to deal
with reST ans Sphinx. It is not a fully correct or something you should trust blindly.
There are probably better ways of doing most of the things you find here.

.. note:: In this document reST and Sphinx are mixed
   (at least in some sections).


More documentation can be found `in the Sphinx page <http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/contents.html>`_.
