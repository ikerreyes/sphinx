Documenting a Python project
============================

This guide is intended to provide information on
how to create technical documentation
for a Python project
using `Sphinx`_.

Some considerations taken form
the `developer guide <https://docs.python.org/devguide/documenting.html>`_:

- More documentation is not necessarily better documentation.
- Use a tone respectful of the reader’s intelligence. Don’t talk down to them or waste their time.
